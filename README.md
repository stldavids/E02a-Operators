# E02a-Operators
An exercise exploring python operators and data types

This repository contains a few files that you will need to alter to complete the assignment. The instructions for the exercise are also on Canvas.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line. They should also appear in a different color in VS Code. The Python Interpreter ignores comments, so you can safely include any information you want there.

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name); you will also be expected to edit README.md (this file) to describe what you have accomplished.

Created the following functions:

add() - Adds two numbers together

sub() - Subtracts a2 from a1

mult() - Multiplies a1 by a2

div() - Divides a1 by a2

floorDiv() - Divides a1 by a2 with remainder rounded down

mod() - Returns the remainder of a1 divided by a2.  e.g., mod(5,3) = 2, mod(15,5) = 0, mod(15,4) = 3

exp() - Returns the a1 to the a2 power (exponent)

orderOperations() - Returns (a1 plus a2) multiplied by a3.  i.e., changes normal order or operations 

whichType() - Returns the python data type of t

convertInt() - Converts i to an integer

convertFloat() - Converts f to a float

convertStr() - Converts s to a string

concat() - Concatenates (string) s2 to the end of s1

whichChar() - Returns the character at position a of string s

substr() - Returns a substring of s (from position a1 to a2)

reverseStr() - Returns a string which is a reversed version of s

isIn() - Returns true if element e is in list l

randomElement() - Returns a random element of list l

randomNumber() - Returns a random number between 1000 and 9999

reverseList() - Returns a list which is a mirror of l (each element is present in reverse order from l)

shuffleList() - Returns a list which has all the elements of l in a random order

listUntil() - Returns a list contains numbers from 0 to a
